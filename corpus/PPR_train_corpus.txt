10094584_5	The effects of various active fractions isolated from oolong tea on noradrenaline-induced lipolysis were examined with isolated fat cells and a cell-free system consisting of lipid droplets and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).

10094584_8	A water extract of oolong tea enhanced noradrenaline-induced lipolysis, and the active substance was identified as caffeine.
10094584	26	29	tea	Plant

10094584_9	Caffeine enhanced noradrenaline-induced lipolysis in fat cells without a concomitant increase in HSL activity and also accelerated the hormone-induced lipolysis in a cell-free system consisting of lipid droplets and HSL, but not in the cell-free system with sonicated lipid droplets and HSL.

10094584_10	Oolong tea extract inhibited pancreatic lipase activity.
10094584	7	10	tea	Plant

10094584_11	CONCLUSION: It was demonstrated that the anti-obesity effects of oolong tea in high-fat diet-treated mice might be due partly to the enhancing effect of caffeine isolated from oolong tea on noradrenaline-induced lipolysis in adipose tissue, and to the inhibitory action of some other substance in oolong tea on pancreatic lipase activity.

10598013_4	MATERIALS AND METHODS: IL-1beta-stimulated synovial cells were used to detect the effects of GTW on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activities, expression of COX protein and mRNA, and nuclear transcription factors in experiments using respective reporter plasmids.
10598013	93	96	GTW	Plant

10598013_5	RESULTS: GTW inhibited prostaglandin E2 production by IL-1beta-stimulated synovial cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and also inhibited COX-2 protein and mRNA expression in a similar fashion to dexamethasone.
10598013	9	12	GTW	Plant

10598013_6	However, GTW did not act as a glucocorticoid agonist.

10598013_8	CONCLUSION: The anti-rheumatic effect of GTW or TWHF may be partly mediated through the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production in human synovial cells due to suppression of COX-2 mRNA, possibly via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activity.

11306704_4	However, mechanisms and targets of its actions are poorly understood.

11306704_5	Anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts of this plant were previously attributed to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and prostaglandin E(2) synthesis.

11306704_6	Here, we show that in primary human femoral head osteoarthritic and normal bovine chondrocytes, TWHF partially or completely inhibited mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-17-inducible MMP-3 and MMP-13.

11306704_7	This agent also inhibited cytokine-stimulated MMP-3 protein expression in human synovial fibroblasts.

11306704_8	A dose range of 2.5 to 10 ng/ml of TWHF was effectively inhibitory for IL-1.
11306704	35	39	TWHF	Plant

11306704_9	Pretreatment for 30 min or 1 h (but not 2-10 h) after IL-1 treatment with TWHF inhibited MMP-3 RNA induction.
11306704	74	78	TWHF	Plant

11306704_10	The inhibitory doses had no adverse effect on the viability of chondrocytes.

11306704_11	Mechanistic studies revealed no impact on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases.

11306704_12	Instead, TWHF partially inhibited DNA binding capacity of cytokine-stimulated activating protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors.
11306704	9	13	TWHF	Plant

11306704_13	Therefore, besides its anti-inflammatory activity, this agent may also be effective in blocking cartilage matrix resorption by MMPs by impairing AP-1 and NF-kappaB binding activities.

11543732_2	Administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to laboratory animals and cultured macrophages induces tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory cytokine.

11543732_3	Pretreatment with Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) inhibited the in vivo production of TNF-alpha (measured by ELISA) after challenge with LPS.

11543732_4	To begin to understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we evaluated the in vitro effects of EGb 761 and its flavonoid component, quercetin, on LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages.
11543732	94	101	EGb 761	Plant

11543732_5	Pretreatment with EGb 761 or quercetin concentration-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha release, as measured by the L929 fibroblast assay.
11543732	18	25	EGb 761	Plant

11543732_6	Northern blotting demonstrated that quercetin inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA, but did not alter its half-life.

11543732_7	Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the redox-sensitive transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), are key events in the signal transduction pathways mediating TNF-alpha induction.

11543732_8	Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2), p38 MAPK, and Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), members of the MAPK family, was analyzed by western blotting.

11543732_9	Our results suggest that quercetin is unique in its ability to inhibit TNF-alpha transcription by inhibiting the phosphorylation and activation of JNK/SAPK and, therefore, suppressing AP-1-DNA binding [assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA)].

11543732_10	Results from western analysis, EMSA, and transient transfections suggest that EGb 761 diminishes LPS-induced NF-kappaB but has no effect on LPS-induced TNF-alpha transcription.
11543732	78	85	EGb 761	Plant

11543732_11	Both EGb 761 and quercetin inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p38 MAPK activity, which are important in the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-alpha mRNA.

11603280_12	The RST extract also produces similar effects as verapamil, a prototype Ca2+ channel antagonist widely used in the treatment of ischemic heart diseases and hypertension, except that verapamil, at 1 mumol/L, a concentration that produces similar cardiac effects as the RST extract, further reduces heart rate significantly during ischemia.

11795518_5	Among various biological effects of green tea, we have focused on its inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha gene expression mediated through inhibition of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation.
11795518	42	45	tea	Plant

11795518_6	Based on our recent results with TNF-alpha-deficient mice, TNF-alpha is an endogenous tumor promoter.

11795518_7	TNF-alpha is also known to be a central mediator in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

11880120_5	METHODS: Using mouse peritoneal macrophages, we have examined the mechanism by which EA regulates NO production.
11880120	85	87	EA	Plant

11880120_6	RESULTS: When EA was used in combination with recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma), there was a marked cooperative induction of NO production.
11880120	14	16	EA	Plant

11880120_7	However, EA had no effect on NO production by itself.
11880120	9	11	EA	Plant

11880120_8	The increased production of NO from rIFN-gamma plus EA-stimulated cells was almost completely inhibited by pre-treatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB).
11880120	52	54	EA	Plant

11880120_9	Furthermore, treatment of peritoneal macrophages with rIFN-gamma plus EA caused a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production.
11880120	70	72	EA	Plant

11880120_10	PDTC also decreased the effects of EA on TNF-alpha production significantly.
11880120	35	37	EA	Plant

11880120_11	CONCLUSIONS: EA increases the production of NO and TNF-alpha by rIFN-gamma-primed macrophages and suggest that NF-kappaB plays a critical role in mediating these effects of EA.

15067330_2	Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi), an oriental medical mushroom, has been widely used in Asian countries for centuries to prevent or treat different diseases, including cancer.

15067330	78	84	cancer	Negative_phenotype

15067330_4	We have previously demonstrated that Ganoderma lucidum down-regulated the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and uPA receptor (uPAR), which resulted in suppression of cell migration of highly invasive human breast and prostate cancer cells.

15067330_6	Our data demonstrate that Ganoderma lucidum inhibits cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner by the down-regulation of expression of cyclin B and Cdc2 and by the up-regulation of p21 expression.
15067330	26	43	Ganoderma lucidum	Plant

15067330_7	The inhibition of cell growth was also demonstrated by cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.

15067330_8	Furthermore, Ganoderma lucidum induced apoptosis of PC-3 cells with a slight decrease in the expression of NF-kappaB-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl.

15067330_9	However, the expression of proapoptotic Bax protein was markedly up-regulated, resulting in the enhancement of the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xl.

15067330_10	Thus, Ganoderma lucidum exerts its effect on cancer cells by multiple mechanisms and may have potential therapeutic use for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

15588681_9	However, p53 expression was only slightly increased as compared to caspase 3 and c-myc.

15588681_10	Thus, the results from this study strongly suggest that the methanol extract of Pereskia bleo may contain bioactive compound(s) that caused breast carcinoma, T-47D cell death by apoptosis mechanism via the activation of caspase-3 and c-myc pathways.

15870944_3	In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms of anti-proliferative effects by aqueous extract of C. militaris (AECM) in human leukemia U937 cells.

15870944_4	It was found that AECM could inhibit cell growth of U937 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with morphological change and apoptotic cell death such as formation of apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation.

15870944	123	127	U937	Negative_phenotype

15870944_6	However, AECM did not affect the pro-apoptotic Bax expression and activity of caspase-9.
15870944	9	13	AECM	Plant

15870944_7	Furthermore, Western blotting and RT-PCR revealed that AECM treatment caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2 accumulation.
15870944	55	59	AECM	Plant

15870944_8	Taken together, these results indicated that the anti-proliferative effects of AECM were associated with the induction of apoptotic cell death through regulation of several major growth regulatory gene products such as Bcl-2 family expression and caspase protease activity, and AECM may have therapeutic potential in human leukemia treatment.

15894133_5	Oral administration of PGF extract markedly lowered plasma glucose levels in non-fasted Zucker diabetic fatty rats (a genetic model of obesity and type 2 diabetes), whereas it had little effect in the fasted animals, suggesting it affected postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

15894133_6	In support of this conclusion the extract was found to markedly inhibit the increase of plasma glucose levels after sucrose loading, but not after glucose loading in mice, and it had no effect on glucose levels in normal mice.

15894133_8	The inhibition is dependent on the concentration of enzyme and substrate, as well as on the length of pretreatment with the enzyme.

15894133_9	These findings strongly suggest that PGF extract improves postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and obesity, at least in part, by inhibiting intestinal alpha-glucosidase activity.

15901350_5	Consistent with these results, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at the protein level, and of iNOS, COX-2 and TNF-alpha at the mRNA level, was also inhibited by MEMO in a concentration-dependent manner.
15901350	213	217	MEMO	Plant

15901350_6	Furthermore, MEMO inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation induced by LPS, and this was associated with the prevention of degradation of the inhibitor kappaB (IkappaB), and subsequently with attenuated p65 protein in the nucleus.

16182479_4	The total crude extract (100 microg/ml) prepared with 80% methanol (MeOH extract) and its fractions (100 microg/ml) obtained by solvent partition with hexane and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) significantly blocked the production of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from RAW264.7 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) up to 20-70%.

16182479_5	The hexane and EtOAc extracts (100 microg/ml) also inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS/interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated macrophages by 65%.

16182479_6	The MeOH extract (100 microg/ml) as well as two fractions (100 microg/ml) prepared by solvent partition with n-butanol (BuOH) and EtOAc strongly suppressed the prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production in LPS/IFN-gamma-activated macrophages up to 70%.

16182479_7	It is interesting to note that hexane, BuOH and EtOAc extracts (100 microg/ml) also inhibited the functional activation of beta1-integrins (CD29) assessed by U937 homotypic aggregation up to 70-80%.

16182479_8	Furthermore, EtOAc and BuOH extracts displayed strong anti-oxidative activity with IC(50) values of 14 and 15 microM, respectively, when tested by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and xanthine oxide (XO) assays.
16182479	54	68	anti-oxidative	Positive_phenotype

16182479_9	Taken together, these data suggest that the anti-inflammatory actions of Cinnamomum camphora may be due to the modulation of cytokine, NO and PGE(2) production and oxidative stress, and of the subfractions tested, the EtOAc extract may be further studied to isolate the active anti-inflammatory principles.

16335796_10	Human monocytic cell (THP-1) derived macrophages were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h.

16335796_11	Such treatment significantly stimulated NO production (253% versus the control).

16335796_12	Such a stimulatory effect was resulted from increased iNOS mRNA expression (270% versus the control) and iNOS activity (169.5% versus the control) in macrophages.

16335796_13	The superoxide anion level was also elevated (150% versus the control) in LPS-treated macrophages.

16540336_5	Following cell culture incubation, PMF was excited using 630 nm laser light.

16540336_6	The photosensitizer exhibited significant photocytotoxicity in both cell lines at a concentration of 60microg/ml, with 4-8 J/cm(2) light dose, resulting in cell destruction from 80% to 86%.

16540336_7	At the concentration of 20microg/ml PMF was not active in either cell line.

16540336_8	These results were compared with the results obtained in the same cell lines, under the same conditions with a clinically approved photosensitizer, Photofrin.

16540336_9	Photofrin was used in the maximum clinically tolerable dose of 4microg/ml, and it was also excited with 630 nm laser light.

16540336_10	In the T24 cell Photofrin exhibited slightly less photocytotocixity, compared with PMF, resulting in 77% cell death with 8J/cm(2) light dose.
16540336	7	10	T24	Negative_phenotype

16540336_11	However, against the RT4 cells Photofrin resulted in minimal cell death (9%) with even 8J/cm(2) light dose.

16540336_12	Finally, the type of cell death induced by PMF photoactivation was studied using flow cytometry and DNA laddering.

16540336_13	Cell death by PMF photodynamic action in these two bladder cell lines is caused predominently by apoptosis.

16540336_14	The reported significant photocytotoxicity, selective localization, natural abundance, easy, and inexpensive preparation, underscore that the PMF extract hold the promise of being a novel, effective PDT photosensitizer.

19703745_9	Several apoptotic signaling pathways were investigated.

19703745_10	RESULTS: SLE scavenged DPPH and also delayed the kinetics of LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner.
19703745	9	12	SLE	Plant

19703745_11	SLE attenuated the level of oxLDL-induced ROS generation, diminished the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and enhanced the expression of adhesion molecules (vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and the adherence of monocytic THP-1 cells to HUVECs.

19703745_12	OxLDL increased the concentration of intracellular calcium, disturbed the balance of the Bcl-2 protein family, destabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased the amount of cytochrome c released into the cytosol, and increased the activation of caspase 3.

19703745_13	These detrimental effects were ameliorated dose-dependently by SLE (P < .05).

21089181_2	However, the mechanism of action is still under discussion.

21089181_3	Despite gaps in our understanding of neurophysiological processes, it is increasingly being recognized that dysfunction of the GABA system is implicated in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety and depressive disorders.

21089181_4	Therefore, the in vitro effects of a dry extract of Passiflora incarnata (sole active ingredient in Pascoflair   425 mg) on the GABA system were investigated.
21089181	52	72	Passiflora incarnata	Plant

21089181_5	The extract inhibited [(3) H]-GABA uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes but had no effect on GABA release and GABA transaminase activity.

21089181_6	Passiflora incarnata inhibited concentration dependently the binding of [(3) H]- SR95531 to GABA(A) -receptors and of [(3) H]-CGP 54626 to GABA(B) -receptors.
21089181	0	20	Passiflora incarnata	Plant

21089181_7	Using the [(35) S]-GTPyS binding assay Passiflora could be classified as an antagonist of the GABA(B) receptor.
21089181	39	49	Passiflora	Plant

21089181_8	In contrast, the ethanol- and the benzodiazepine-site of the GABA(A) -receptor were not affected by this extract.

21089181_9	In conclusion, the first evidence was shown that numerous pharmacological effects of Passiflora incarnata are mediated via modulation of the GABA system including affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake.

23542147_4	MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant ethanolic extracts were initially tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in human U937 monocytes.

23542147_5	The effect of the plant extracts on the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway was evaluated in TNF-a stimulated HepG2 cells by luciferase gene reporter assay and Western blotting at the transcriptional and translational levels.

23542147_6	Subsequently, the inhibition of NF-kB downstream gene expression (IL-8 and ICAM-1) by the plant extracts was assessed via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

23542147_7	Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts in vivo were evaluated by testing spleen index and NF-kB related protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD1 mice.

23542147_8	RESULTS: The plant ethanolic extracts effectively suppressed PGE2, IL-6 and TNF release with an IC50 less than 50  g/ml.

23542147_9	Moreover, luciferase expression could be specifically blocked in HepG2 cells, not in HEK293 cells, showing that the plant extracts displayed a cell-specific pattern on NF-kB gene transcription.
23542147	65	70	HepG2	Negative_phenotype

23542147_10	The assayed biological activity also depended on the order of adding TNF-a and the plant extracts because the plant extracts could only block the NF-kB activation if added earlier but were unable to stop the signal when added after TNF-a.

23542147_11	However, the plant extracts did not exert any effect on ubiquitination which regulates several steps in the NF-kB pathway.

23542147_12	Additionally, the plant extracts down-regulated phosphorylation of IKKa/b at S176/180, p38 at T180/Y182 and p65 at S536, but not p65 at S276.

23542147_13	This was confirmed by their ability to selectively abrogate the induction of IL-8 transcription, whereas the ICAM-1 gene, which is not transcribed selectively by an NF-kB complex containing a form of p65 phosphorylated on Ser536, did not change.

23542147_14	Finally, the plant extracts at 200  g/mg could normalize the LPS-induced elevation of spleen index as well as NF-kB and p38 activations in CD1 mice.

23542147_15	CONCLUSION: The present studies presents the potential utilization of this plant extracts, as a natural resources for the development of an anti-inflammatory medicine.

24747135_5	Furthermore, we examined the expression levels of TGF-b1 and its receptor.

24747135_6	KEY FINDINGS: In cultured RTECs (NRK-52E), AA promoted renal EMT and ECM accumulation by up-regulating the expression of mesenchymal markers and ECM components and by down-regulating the expression of epithelial markers.

24747135_7	In addition, AA induced an imbalance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 and enhanced expression of TGF-b1 and its receptor.

24747135_8	SSBE treatment significantly inhibited AA-induced TGF-b1 expression and prevented the induction of EMT and deposition of ECM.

25260581_5	Seventy rats were divided into seven groups.

25260581_6	After oral administration of AHT and TFA (100 or 200mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks, the prostate index (PI), 5a-reductase (5a-R) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were determined.

25260581_7	Then the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were determined.

25260581_8	In addition, the relative inflammatory factors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin 1b (IL-1b), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) were measured.

25260581_9	Finally, the prostatic expression of nuclear transcription factor-kB (NF-kB) and phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt were determined by immunohistochemistry.

25260581_10	The prostatic expression of Bcl-2 was determined by western blot analysis.

25260581_11	RESULTS: The results showed that AHT and TFA decreased serum DHT and 5a-R activities compared with model group, as well as the PI and histopathological examination findings.

25260581_12	In addition, oral treatment of AHT and TFA can significantly increase the activities of SOD, GPx and CAT while the level of MDA was significantly decreased compared with the model group.

25260581_13	Moreover, AHT and TFA remarkably decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in prostatic tissue.

25260581_14	Further investigation demonstrated that AHT and TFA treatment down-regulated the protein expressions of p-Akt, NF-kB and Bcl-2.

25260581_15	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AHT and TFA have anti-BPH properties via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-proliferative effects.

25917841_10	Activation of the Notch signaling pathway was evaluated by analyzing expressions of Notch-1, -2, -3, -4, Jagged 1 (JAG1), Delta-like (DLL)-1, -3, -4, Hes1, Numb and RBP-Jk.

25917841_11	Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway was evaluated by analyzing expressions of Wnt-4, -5a, -5b, Frizzled (Fzd)-2, -3, -6 and b-catenin.

25917841_12	RESULTS: (1) Compared with the BDL group, AS significantly reduced the deposition of collagen and the Hyp content of liver tissue and inhibited the activation of HSCs.

25917841_13	In addition, AS significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-b1 and a-SMA.

25917841_14	In contrast, AS significantly enhanced expression of the Smad 7 protein.

25917841_15	AS also reduced biliary epithelial cell proliferation, and reduced the mRNA and protein expressions of CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19, OV6, Sox9 and EpCAM.

26418168	143	146	CIA	Negative_phenotype

26418168_10	Interestingly, TS prevented bone destruction by reducing the number of osteoclasts in inflamed joints, reducing the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kF (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and RANK, increasing the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG), at both mRNA and protein levels, and decreasing the ratio of RANKL to OPG in inflamed joints and sera of CIA rats.

26418168_11	This was further confirmed in the co-culture system of human fibroblast-like synovial and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

26418168_12	In addition, TS inhibited the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in bone resorption, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 in sera and joints.

26418168_13	These findings offer convincing evidence that TS attenuate RA partially by preventing both focal bone destruction and systemic bone loss.

26507490_8	Interestingly, there was a marked decrease in the activation of the ER stress response and insulin resistance in the livers of the C57BL/6J-db/db mice treated with CTL due to decreases in the phosphorylation of eIF2a, IRE1a, and IRS-1 serine and decreases in the mRNA expression of ATF4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, C/EBPa, and C/EBP homologous protein.

26792956_7	Separation of the phytochemical compounds was done by open column chromatography.

26792956_8	The extracts were eluted out with gradients of chloroform-methanol solvents.

26792956_9	Ultraviolet-visible spectra of individual fractions were recorded, and the fractions were combined based on their   max.

26792956_10	The free radical scavenging activity of crude extracts and fractions obtained was also determined; the radical scavenging activity was expressed as IC50.

26792956_11	High-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of fractionated compounds was carried out to identify partially the phytochemical compounds.

26792956_12	The anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity of AT and CC extracts was studied in DEN induced BALB/c mice by analyzing the tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) levels in serum and the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) binding activity in nuclear extracts of the liver.

26851499_11	Phytochemical studies indicated presence of many phenolic glycosides like symplocoside, triterpenoids like betulinic acid, acetyloleanolic acid and oleanolic acid and flavonoids like quercetin which might have contributed to the observed protective effects.

26851499_12	CONCLUSION: Many ethno botanical claims have been confirmed through systematic in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological studies on different extracts of stem bark and isolated constituents.

26851499_13	However, systematic studies on the bio-markers are desirable to establish mode of action and to validate the traditional claim in clinical practice after proper safety assessment.

26851499_14	The conservation data of genus Symplocos showed risk of extinction due to restricted distribution in the wild hence systematic techniques should be developed for the maintenance of this plant.

26923541_5	MATERIAL AND METHODS: Under anesthesia condition, SD rats (n=6) were successively suffered two surgeries for implanting cannulas at lateral ventricle and right jugular vein for brain microdialysis and blood collection, respectively.

26923541_6	After recovery, the rats received intravenous dose of PIF at 80mg/kg and the concentrations of puerarin (PU), 3'-methoxypuerarin (MPU), 3'-hydroxypuerarin (HPU)   daidzein (DA) and daidzein-8-C-apiosyl-(1-6)-glycoside (DAC) in the ventricular dialysate and plasma samples were determined using a ultra-fast liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.
26923541	54	57	PIF	Plant

26923541_7	RESULTS: Complete concentration versus time profiles of the five components in plasma and four components except for HPU in ventricular CSF were obtained.

26923541_8	After dosing, the average C0 values of PU, MPU, DA, DAC and HPU in plasma were estimated 6.53, 13.72, 1.54, 15.84 and 86.07  g/mL, and PU, MPU, DA and DAC were rapidly penetrated to the brain and reached to their Cmax of 521.52, 415.00, 74.34 and 380.03 ng/mL in CSF at about 0.5-0.8h, respectively.

26923541_9	The elimination t1/2 of PU, DA and DAC in CSF and plasma were no significant difference, while the t1/2 of MPU in ventricular CSF was longer than that in plasma which may attributable to the different physiological environment of central and peripheral compartments.

26923541_10	The brain penetration index (AUCCSF/AUCplasma) was found to be about 9.29, 7.25, 11.96, and 4.21% for PU, MPU, DA, and DAC respectively.

26951885_4	The results from MTT assays revealed that cell proliferation significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the cells treated with a-mangostin.

26951885_5	DAPI staining illustrated that chromatin condensation in the cells treated with 15    M a-mangostin was far greater than that in the untreated cells.

26951885_6	Flow cytometric analysis indicated that a-mangostin suppressed YD-15 cell viability by inducing apoptosis and promoting cell cycle arrest in the sub-G1  phase.
26951885	63	68	YD-15	Negative_phenotype

26951885_7	Western blot analysis of various signaling molecules revealed that a-mangostin targeted the extracellular signal  -regulated kinase  1/2  (ERK1/2) and p38  mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK) signaling pathways through the inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38  phosphorylation in a dose  -dependent manner.

26951885_8	a-mangostin also increased the levels of Bax  (pro-apoptotic), cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase  (PARP), whereas the levels of the anti-apoptotic factors, Bcl-2 and c-myc, decreased in a dose-dependent manner.

26951885_9	The anticancer effects of a-mangostin were also investigated in a tumor xenograft mouse model.

27836777_6	Apoptotic cells were detected by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI) staining.

27836777_7	We also investigated whether the growth-inhibitory effects were associated with the induction of apoptosis and whether the mechanisms of cell death were the result of signaling molecules such as p53, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-9, Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and Erk (Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) 1/2.

27836777_8	The in vivo antitumor effects were evaluated by measuring the tumor volume and weight and performing Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor xenograft models.

27836777_10	In addition, several apoptotic events were observed following treatment, including DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation by DAPI staining.

27836777_11	The extracts increased p53, Bax, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-PARP expression, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased in both cell lines.

27836777_12	Furthermore, ID extract significantly inhibited the activation of Erk1/2 in both cell lines.

27869910_3	In this report, we reveal that the methanol-ethyl acetate partitioned fraction from Chinese olive fruits (MEO), of which ellagic acid accounted for 12%, exhibited profound anti-proliferative activities in the human colon cancer cell line, HCT116.

27869910_5	Treatment with MEO induced a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells and resulted in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, suggesting that MEO inhibits cancer cell proliferation by promoting apoptosis.

27869910_7	This process employed the use of reporter-based bio-platforms that are capable of detecting the activation of NF-kB.

27869910_8	In addition, phosphorylation of NF-kB signaling-associated proteins, IKKa/b, IkBa, and p65, was reduced in MEO-incubated cancer cells, indicating that MEO suppresses NF-kB activation.

27869910_9	Moreover, MEO treatment significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cancer cell proliferation, demonstrating that MEO promotes cancer cell apoptosis through the inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway.
