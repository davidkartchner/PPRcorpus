12576200_4	Cumene hydroperoxide treatment (30 mg per animal) increased cutaneous microsomal lipid peroxidation and induction of xanthine oxidase activity which are accompanied by decrease in the activities of cutaneous antioxidant enzymes and depletion in the level of glutathione.

12576200_5	Parallel to these changes a sharp decrease in the activities of phase II metabolizing enzymes was observed.

12576200_6	Cumene hydroperoxide treatment also induced the ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhanced the [3H]-thymidine uptake in DNA synthesis in murine skin.

12576200_7	Application of ethanolic extract of H. indicus at a dose level of 1.5 and 3.0mg/kg body weight in acetone prior to that of cumene hydroperoxide treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cumene hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress, epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhanced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner.

12586294_6	Nitrite was measured by Griess assay, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) by radioimmunoassay, and cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

12586294_7	iNOS and COX-2 were determined by Western blot, activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 by EMSA.

12586294_8	RESULTS: P. amarus EtOH/H(2)O and hexane extracts showed an inhibition of LPS-induced production of NO and PGE(2) in KC and in RAW264.7.

12586294_9	The extracts also attenuated the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in RAW264.7 as well as in human whole blood.

12586294_10	Both extracts reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 and inhibited activation of NF-kappaB, but not of AP-1.

12586294_11	P. amarus inhibited induction of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-10, and interferon-gamma in human whole blood and reduced TNF-alpha production in vivo.

14653114_5	Hybridization with a cDNA microarray was conducted using a probe of fluorescent-labeled cDNA mixture that was reversely transcribed from the RNA.

14653114_6	The gene expression level was analyzed after scanning the fluorescent intensity by a laser scanner, and further confirmed by RT-PCR.

14653114_7	RESULTS: After using Coptis Chinensis compound for 30 days, the size of transplanted tumors were remarkably reduced, and the inhibition rate of tumor growth was 29.5%.

15680312_6	Thus, we are interested to investigate whether Toona sinensis has any effect on mouse Leydig cell testosterone production, which correlates to sperm activity.
15680312	47	61	Toona sinensis	Plant

15680312_7	Primary mouse Leydig cells were purified to conduct the in vitro experiments.

15680312_8	Different concentrations of crude Toona sinensis were added to primary mouse Leydig cells and the testosterone production was determined.
15680312	34	48	Toona sinensis	Plant

15680312_9	The results showed that crude TS significantly inhibited both basal and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated testosterone productions in dose dependent manner, respectively (P<0.05).
15680312	30	32	TS	Plant

15680312_10	Crude TS also reduced the forskolin- and dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP)-stimulated testosterone production (P<0.05), which indicated that crude TS might affect protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway at the site after the formation of cyclic AMP.
15680312	6	8	TS	Plant
15680312	137	139	TS	Plant

15680312_11	Moreover, TS inhibited Leydig cell steroidogenesis by suppressing the activity of steroidogenic enzymes including P450 side chain cleavage enzyme, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 20 alpha-hydroxylase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (P<0.05).
15680312	10	12	TS	Plant

15680312_12	In summary, these results suggested that TS inhibited steroidogenesis by suppressing the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and the activities of steroidogenic enzymes in normal mouse Leydig cells.

15710356_4	The results show that HCA, among the derivatives, most significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production and NF-kappa B transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 8 and 22 microM, respectively.

15710356_5	We next investigated putative possible mechanisms of inhibitory effect of HCA on NO production.

15710356_6	The inhibition of NO by HCA was consistent with the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression.

15710356_7	Moreover, HCA inhibited LPS-induced p50 and p65 translocation resulting in the inhibition of the DNA binding activity of the NF-kappa B, a central regulator of iNOS.

15710356_8	The present results provided evidence that HCA, among cinnamaledhyde derivatives, has the most inhibitory effect on NO production through inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, and thus can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent.

16465544_3	METHODS: We have evaluated the cytotoxicity profiles of 157 extracts prepared from dietary or medical plants growing in the Okinawa island, using 10 different cell lines.

16465544_4	In vitro cytotoxicity screening indicated the presence of a highly selective cytotoxic compound in the extract of Toddalia asiatica Lam.
16465544	114	136	Toddalia asiatica Lam.	Plant

16465544_5	The known alkaloid (1,3)benzodioxolo(5,6-c)phenanthridine, 12,13-dihydro-2,3-dimethoxy-12-methyl-(dihydronitidine) was identified as an active material from this plant.

16465544_6	This alkaloid had highly specific cytotoxicity to human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells.

16865287_3	We have previously demonstrated that G. lucidum inhibits growth and induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through the inhibition of Akt/NF-kappaB signaling in estrogen-independent human breast cancer cells.

16865287_4	However, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the inhibitory effects of G. lucidum on the proliferation of estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells remain to be elucidated.

16951721_3	Disruption in the insulin secretion of pancreatic beta cells is considered the major cause of diabetes.
16951721	94	102	diabetes	Negative_phenotype

16951721_4	A mitochondrial protein, uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) has been found to play a critical role in insulin synthesis and beta cell survival.
16951721	128	136	survival	Positive_phenotype

16951721_5	Our preliminary studies found that the extracts of American ginseng inhibit UCP-2 expression which may contribute to the ability of ginseng protecting beta cell death and improving insulin synthesis.
16951721	60	67	ginseng	Plant
16951721	132	139	ginseng	Plant

16951721_6	Therefore, we hypothesized that ginseng extracts suppress UCP-2 in the mitochondria of pancreatic beta cells, promoting insulin synthesis and anti-apoptosis (a programmed cell-death mechanism).
16951721	32	39	ginseng	Plant

16951721_7	To test the hypothesis, the serum-deprived quiescent beta cells were cultured with or without interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), (200 pg ml(-1), a cytokine to induce beta cell apoptosis) and water extracts of American ginseng (25 mug per 5 mul administered to wells of 0.5 ml culture) for 24 h.
16951721	213	220	ginseng	Plant

16951721_8	We evaluated effects of ginseng on UCP-2 expression, insulin production, anti-/pro-apoptotic factors Bcl-2/caspase-9 expression and cellular ATP levels.
16951721	24	31	ginseng	Plant

16951721_9	We found that ginseng suppresses UCP-2, down-regulates caspase-9 while increasing ATP and insulin production/secretion and up-regulates Bcl-2, reducing apoptosis.
16951721	14	21	ginseng	Plant

16951721_10	These findings suggest that stimulation of insulin production and prevention of beta cell loss by American ginseng extracts can occur via the inhibition of mitochondrial UCP-2, resulting in increase in the ATP level and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while down-regulation of pro-apoptotic factor caspase-9 occurs, lowering the occurrence of apoptosis, which support the hypothesis.

21296646_9	Although many of the experimental studies validated its traditional medicinal uses, but employed uncharacterized crude extracts.

21296646_10	Thus, it is difficult to reproduce the results and pinpoint the bioactive metabolite.

21296646_11	Hence, there is a need of phytochemical standardization and bioactivity-guided identification of bioactive metabolites.

21296646_12	The results of few pharmacological studies and bioactive metabolites already reported in F. religiosa warrant detailed investigation for its potential against cancer, cardiovascular disorders, neuroinflammatory disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders, oxidative stress related disorders and parasitic infections.

23769983_8	The aqueous extract induced mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) indicating differentiation of macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1 polarized macrophages.

23769983_9	The total flavonoid, alkaloid extracts and an alkaloid fraction induced the expression of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) on the surface of the polarized macrophages that could lead to the activation of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype.

23769983_10	Aqueous and flavonoid extracts enhanced NADPH quinine oxido-reductase 1 (NQO1) mRNA expression in polarized macrophages which could play an important role in cancer chemoprevention.

24635344_3	OBJECTIVES: In order to determine if extracts from black seed have any effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), we characterized the effects of black seed extract on apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) gene expression, the primary protein component of HDL.
24635344	51	61	black seed	Plant
24635344	146	156	black seed	Plant

24635344_4	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatocytes (HepG2) and intestinal cells (Caco-2) were treated with black seed extracts, and Apo A-I, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa), and retinoid-x-receptor a (RXRa) were measured by Western blot analysis.
24635344	91	101	black seed	Plant

24635344_5	Apo A-I mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and apo A-I gene transcription was measured by transient transfection of apo A-I reporter plasmids.

24635344_6	RESULTS: Extracts from black seeds significantly increased hepatic and intestinal apo A-I secretion, as well as apo A-I mRNA and gene promoter activity.
24635344	23	34	black seeds	Plant

24635344_7	This effect required a PPARa binding site in the apo A-I gene promoter.

24635344_8	Treatment of the extract with either heat or trypsin had no effect on its ability to induce apo A-I secretion.

24635344_9	Treatment with black seed extract induced PPARa expression 9-fold and RXRa expression 2.5-fold.
24635344	15	25	black seed	Plant

24635344_10	Furthermore, the addition of PPARa siRNA but not a control siRNA prevented some but not all the positive effects of black seed on apo A-I secretion.
24635344	116	126	black seed	Plant

24635344_11	DISCUSSION: Black seed extract is a potent inducer of apo A-I gene expression, presumably by enhancing PPARa/RXRa expression.

24660592_4	Apoptosis induction was assessed by an Annexin V binding assay in cells exposed to extracts at a high concentration (200 g/mL).

24660592_5	To verify the mechanism of apoptosis, ER expression and its related signaling was investigated using an immunoblot assay under the same conditions.

24660592_6	RESULTS: MCF-7 cells showed the strongest antiproliferative response to the tested extracts.

24660592_7	However, a biphasic effect was observed: the extracts inhibited proliferation at high concentrations whereas they stimulated it at low ones.

24660592_8	ER expression was similarly modulated by the extracts.

24660592_9	However, all of the extracts induced apoptosis at a high concentration (200 g/mL).

24660592_10	Compared to the control level, exposure to the extracts resulted in a remarkable increase in the shift of cell populations.

24660592_11	CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the tested Artemisia species exerted their anticancer effects through the induction of apoptosis via an ER-related pathway.

24898576_4	Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells were used as a model.

24898576_5	Cell viability and morphological changes were studied by the MTT assay and microscopy.

24898576_6	mRNA expression of pro  -inflammatory mediators was assessed by both semi  -quantitative reverse transcription  -polymerase chain reaction  (RT  -PCR) and quantitative (q) RT  -PCR.

24898576_7	Nitric oxide  (NO) and prostaglandin  E2 (PGE2) production were analyzed by the Griess test and sandwich enzyme  -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively.

24898576_8	The activation of kinase cascades was studied by immunoblotting.

24898576_9	Our findings showed that PLE slightly affects cell viability, but alleviates LPS  -induced activation of RAW264.7 cells.
24898576	25	28	PLE	Plant

24898576_10	Furthermore, PLE significantly reduced the LPS  -induced mRNA expression of the interleukin (IL)  -6, IL  -8, tumor necrosis factor  -a  (TNF  -a), cyclooxygenase  -2  (COX  -2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase  (iNOS), genes in a dose  -dependent manner.

26115086_7	Our results further showed that HLE exerted an inhibitory effect on the activity and expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).
26115086	32	35	HLE	Plant

26115086_8	The HLE-inhibited MMP-9 expression appeared to be a consequence of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) inactivation because its DNA-binding activity was suppressed by HLE.

26115086	161	164	HLE	Plant

26115086_9	Molecular data showed all these influences of HLE might be mediated via inhibition of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt)/NF-kB/MMP-9 cascade pathway, as demonstrated by the transfection of Akt1 overexpression vector.
26115086	46	49	HLE	Plant

26115086_10	Finally, the inhibitory effect of HLE was proven by its inhibition on the growth of LNCaP cells and the expressions of metastasis-related molecular proteins in vivo.

26593213_9	Compounds 1-4 displayed potent anti-inflammatory activity, while 7 and 8 showed moderate activity.
26593213	31	48	anti-inflammatory	Positive_phenotype

26593213_10	Compounds 1-8 exhibited a concentration-related decrease in the levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, PGE2, lipoxgenase-5, and COX-2.

26593213_11	Compounds 5 and 6 did not significantly decrease levels of different cytokines, PGE2, lipoxgenase-5, and COX-2 from PHA treatment at 1   M. However, all tested compounds significantly decreased cytokines, PGE2, lipoxgenase-5, and COX-2 levels at concentration 100   M. It is noteworthy that compounds 1-4 had the highest activity, where it lowered levels of cytokines, PGE2, lipoxgenase-5, and COX-2 to the extent that was no statistical difference from the control group.

26593213_12	Thus, they decreased proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) with decreased level of the target enzymes (COX-2 and lipoxgenase-5) and subsequent reduction of its inflammatory product (PGE2).

26593213_13	CONCLUSION: Good anti-inflammatory activities exhibited of the isolated compounds from C. speciosus corroborate the usefulness of this plant in the traditional treatment of inflammation and related symptoms.

27111520_3	OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: This study examined the inhibitory effects of sophoraflavanone G (SF) of S. flavescens on the bacterial fibrillar protein, Antigen I/II (AgI/II)-N recombinant protein isolated from Streptococcus mutans(rAg I/II)-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).

27111520	203	223	Streptococcus mutans	Negative_phenotype

27111520_4	The investigation was focused on whether SF could inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG) E2 as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-6, nuclear factor (NF)-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in rAgI/II-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells using Griess reagent, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blotting analysis.

27111520_5	RESULTS: SG significantly inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor a in Ag I/II-N-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, which were mediated by the down-regulation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression.

27111520_6	The SF inhibited the phosphorylation of IkB-a, nuclear translocation of p65, and subsequent activation of NF- kB in the rAgI/II-stimulated cells.

27111520_7	In addition, the SF suppressed the rAgI/II-stimulated activation of ERK MAPK as well as the MAPK inhibitor significantly reduced the rAgI/II-induced production of NO and PGE2.

27111520_8	CONCLUSION: Collectively, we suggest that the SF inhibits the expression and production of inflammatory mediators by blocking the ERK MAPK mediated pathway and inhibiting the activation of NF-kB.
